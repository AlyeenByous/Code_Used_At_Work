# Code_Used_At_Work
This is code that I have used to make repetitive or tedious tasks at work quicker and easier.

So far it's all in Python. Some of the ways I've done it may not be the best or most efficient, but I had to get it done quickly, or else it's not making anything quicker or easier! So I did what I could come up with quickly.
